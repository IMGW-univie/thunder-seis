## Abstract
> We obtain a large dataset of seismic data from the temporary seismic network AlpArray in Europe and a large dataset of lightning data from the Lightning Location System - ALDIS and focus on the investigation of thunder signals recorded with seismic stations in a frequency range of 2-49 Hz. We try to establish whether important information about the lightning flash can be determined independently of optical and electrical measurements, through the means of seismic analysis. Seismic data provide useful information on thunder and lightning and we observe a correlation between lightning peak current and maximum ground displacement induced by the thunder for positive Cloud-to-Ground flashes of lightning.
